## Various issues in data visualisation

Data visualisation can be defined as _the visual representation and presentation of data to facilitate understanding_.
It involves seeing data using _marks_ (for example, shapes) and _attributes_
 such as size, position, and colours.
 
The understanding process involves three steps:
- Perceiving (what do I see?)
- Interpreting (what does it mean for the subject?)
- Comprehending (what does it mean to me?)
These three processes are intrinsically uncertain, we cannot be sure that understanding happens for everyone in the way we expect or want it to happen. Therefore, data visualisation can be seen as a game of decisions. To make the best decisions, you need to be familiar with all your options (things you could do) and aware of the things that will influence your choices (things you will do).

Three points of effective and efficient design process:
- trustworthy: is it reliable?
- accessible: is it usable?
- elegant: is it aesthetics?
 
### choosing the right visual representations for the data and task at hand
### Anscombe's quartet
### visual analysis as individual/social process

In a sea of data, data visualisation represents a time-constrained activity which offers options to represent data analysis, making users/people aware of the different options they have. Dataviz can be considered an *informed list of possibilities* that empowers people instead of overwhelming them.

color schemes and other visual cues significantly help to convey the message behind the data representation.
When collecting data through a form, it is crucial to tailor the form itself to the specific population it refers to (for example, using bigger font for older people).
it is also crucial to design for _accurate_ data collection and maximise data quality.

different concerns with observational vs experimental data
dataviz can, and should, help "data finds data" processes (see "Beautiful Data"). 

### Importance of considering gender issues when approaching data and data visualisation
"Users" are not all white men from a medium-high socioeconomic background, in a USA setting. 
Male should *not* be the 'default' option, this attitude limits data accessibility, applicability, and generalizability. 
As thoroughly described and argued by Caroline Criado Perez ("Invisible Women", 2019), taking gender data into account in (city/transport/local plan) planning requires changes and solutions that have a ripple effect with broader consequences on the general society.

### Data accessibility
How do you qualify what you produce in terms of data visualisation?

### Possible negative effects of data collection?

### tendency to create a story out of noise!

[The chartmaker territory](https://chartmaker.visualisingdata.com/) provides a valuable resource for deciding what type of chart you shoud use depending on the type of data you are working with and, even more relevantly(?), the relation between data that you want to highlight.

Use of colours and accessibility: [colororacle](www.colororacle.org) is a colour blindness simulator, allowing data scientists to consider colour branding and output restrictions when working on their charts.
