### Various issues in data visualisation

## choosing the right visual representations for the data and task at hand
## Anscombe's quartet
## visual analysis as individual/social process

In a sea of data, data visualisation represents a time-constrained activity which offers options to represent data analysis, making users/people aware of the different options they have. Dataviz can be considered an *informed list of possibilities* that empowers people instead of overwhelming them.
tradeoff between having a large amount of information and knowing what to do with it

color schemes and other visual cues significantly help to convey the message behind the data representation.
When collecting data through a form, it is crucial to tailor the form itself to the specific population it refers to (for example, using bigger font for older people).
it is also crucial to design for _accurate_ data collection and maximise data quality.

different concerns with observational vs experimental data
dataviz can, and should, help "data finds data" processes (see "Beautiful Data"). 

### Importance of considering gender issues when approaching data and data visualisation
"Users" are not all white men from a medium-high socioeconomic background, in a USA setting. 
Male should *not* be the 'default' option, this attitude limits data accessibility, applicability, and generalizability. 
As thoroughly described and argued by Caroline Criado Perez ("Invisible Women", 2019), taking gender data into account in (city/transport/local plan) planning requires changes and solutions that have a ripple effect with broader consequences on the general society.

### Data accessibility
How do you qualify what you produce in terms of data visualisation?

### Possible negative effects of data collection?
